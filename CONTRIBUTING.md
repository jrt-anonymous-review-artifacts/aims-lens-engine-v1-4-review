# Contributing to AIMS Lens Engine

AIMS Lens Engine accepts public-safe improvements to company lenses, schemas,
validation cases, governance documents, and tooling.

## Contribution Boundary

Good contributions:

- Use public sources, properly cited summaries, and clear confidence levels.
- Improve schemas, validation tools, routing rules, or public examples.
- Add public company lens material that is non-verbatim and independently useful.
- Mark uncertainty, source limitations, and role or geography constraints.
- Preserve the distinction between public lens content and private reference client data.

Do not contribute:

- Raw copyrighted articles, copied job postings, paywalled materials, or private
  employer documents.
- Candidate resumes, candidate answers, tenant uploads, user-submitted job
  bodies, review logs, API keys, tokens, database paths, or production configs.
- Any material marked `private_only`, `tenant_upload`, `candidate_answer`,
  `candidate_resume`, `internal_review_record`, or `private_scoring_calibration`.
- Claims that a public lens is an official company hiring standard.
- Company logos, trademarks, or brand assets unless their usage rights are clear.

## Evidence Classes

Use these public evidence classes:

- `public_source`: official or openly available company materials.
- `public_community_aggregate`: aggregated public community patterns with lower
  confidence and clear limitations.
- `private_distillation_public_safe`: non-verbatim, public-safe signal distilled
  from private or paid material, with no raw text, no user-specific details, and
  no tenant or candidate data.

Never use `private_only` evidence in public lens files.

## Pull Request Checklist

Before opening a pull request:

1. Keep edits scoped to public-safe files.
2. Cite sources in `evidence.md` or the relevant documentation.
3. Do not include raw source text beyond short fair-use snippets.
4. Run the public export and scanner:

   ```bash
   python tools/export_public_release.py --execute --clean
   python tools/scan_public_export.py --allowlist
   python tools/generate_public_release_audit_report.py --allowlist
   python tools/validate_public_lens_coverage.py --min-companies 12
   python tools/prepare_public_lens_refresh.py
   ```

5. Confirm the generated audit report has no blockers and no unresolved review
   findings.

## Automated Updates

Routine public-safe refreshes can be handled by automation when the scanner and
coverage checks pass. New company lenses, new industries, private-derived
signals, schema changes, routing changes, lens status promotions, or any scanner
finding still require maintainer review. See
`docs/public-lens-refresh-and-expansion.md`.

Scheduled maintenance opens an automated refresh-candidate PR from repository
metadata. That PR may be merged as routine maintenance when it only updates the
generated candidate report. It must be reviewed manually if it is expanded to
change company lens content.

## Review Standard

Maintainers may reject or rewrite contributions that are useful but not
public-safe. The default rule is simple: when in doubt, keep the public lens
non-verbatim, evidence-aware, and privacy-preserving.
