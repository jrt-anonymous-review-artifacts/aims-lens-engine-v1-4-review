# Paper-to-Code Map

This map is the reviewer-oriented index for manuscript v1.3. It links paper claims to the smallest public artifact that makes the claim inspectable. Executable traceability is distinct from runtime integration; see `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INTEGRATION_COVERAGE_MATRIX.md` for that separation.

The historical v1.3 release gate remains validator + unit tests + deterministic demo + Experiments 1A/1B/2/3. For the v1.4 corrective branch, additionally run Experiments 4/5 and documentation alignment, with the committed-output reproducibility gate defined in `.github/workflows/paper-artifact-ci.yml`.
