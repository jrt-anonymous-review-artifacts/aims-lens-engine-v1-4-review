# Math-to-Code Completeness Audit — Manuscript v1.3

**Scope.** This audit maps every mathematical expression in manuscript Section 5, every algorithm/listing that defines public research behavior, and every stated operational threshold to the paper-release reference artifact. It distinguishes reproducible reference logic from empirical quantities that have not yet been fitted or validated.

## A. Equations 1–15

| Eq. | Manuscript construct | Reference artifact | Status | Boundary / note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | DAG joint factorization | `research_core/dag.py::joint_factorization`, `validate_dag` | Complete reference logic | Caller supplies declared local conditionals; no undeclared edges are inferred. |
| 2 | Logistic stopping model | `research_core/stopping.py::stopping_probability` | Complete functional form | Coefficients are not claimed to be empirically fitted. |
| 3 | Compatibility masking and renormalization | `research_core/compatibility.py::masked_and_renormalized` | Complete | Returns no distribution when every category is masked, enabling abstention. |
| 4 | Generic → archetype → industry → company Dirichlet hierarchy | `research_core/inference.py::hierarchical_partial_pooling` | Reference-complete for inference logic | Hyperparameter learning is not implemented because the manuscript does not claim fitted hyperparameters. |
| 5 | Authorization-gated, quality- and recency-weighted counts | `research_core/evidence.py::weighted_counts`, `exponential_recency_weight` | Complete and equation-aligned | Authorization is binary; recency is exactly `exp(-delta * age)`. |
| 6 | Company posterior Dirichlet parameters | `research_core/inference.py::posterior_alpha` | Complete | Works with fractional effective counts. |
| 7 | Posterior mean | `research_core/inference.py::posterior_mean` | Complete | Direct normalized posterior-alpha calculation. |
| 8 | Routed predictive mixture | `research_core/routing.py::route_mixture` | Corrected v1.4 fail-closed logic | Routing components are restricted to permitted categories and contribute only when positive permitted mass remains. Zero-permitted-mass components are excluded rather than converted to a uniform distribution. |
| 9 | Routing weights | `research_core/routing.py::route_mixture` | Corrected v1.4 fail-closed logic | Implements authorization × applicability × coverage × gamma^distance, then normalizes weights only across components that retain positive probability mass on permitted categories. |
| 10 | Normalized entropy | `research_core/uncertainty.py::normalized_entropy` | Complete and corrected | Denominator uses permitted category count `K_L`, not only non-zero entries. |
| 11 | Data-support score `1-exp(-n_eff/tau)` | `research_core/uncertainty.py::data_support`, `research_core/service.py::prioritize_followups` | Corrected v1.4 reference logic | `n_eff` used for release/abstention is the sum of authorization-, quality-, and recency-weighted counts over the current permitted categories only. Compatibility-masked categories contribute zero released support. Explicitly not a correctness probability. |
| 12 | Multiclass Brier score | `research_core/evaluation.py::multiclass_brier` | Complete | Evaluation only; does not assert calibration. |
| 13 | Top-label ECE | `research_core/evaluation.py::top_label_ece` | Corrected v1.4 calibration diagnostic | Bins by predicted top-class confidence and compares mean confidence with empirical top-label accuracy. The former `vector_ece` is retained only as a supplementary diagnostic because opposing class-vector errors can cancel within a bin. ECE remains a diagnostic rather than evidence that calibration has been externally established. |
| 14 | KL drift statistic | `research_core/evaluation.py::kl_divergence` | Complete | Threshold remains an empirical policy setting. |
| 15 | Expected parameter information gain | `research_core/active_learning.py::expected_information_gain` | Corrected reference operationalization | Computes one-record Dirichlet-parameter posterior information gain (equivalently `I(Theta;Y)`) for already-authorized records. The former predictive category-entropy reduction is retained separately as `predictive_entropy_reduction` and is not Eq. 15. |

### Posterior uncertainty

The manuscript also states that Dirichlet posteriors provide credible intervals. `research_core/inference.py::credible_intervals` supplies deterministic-seed Monte Carlo marginal intervals using only the Python standard library. These are **conditional Dirichlet intervals given the supplied parameter vector**. Under the recursive plug-in hierarchy, upper-level posterior uncertainty is not propagated through those intervals. Experiment 5 separately quantifies that approximation under a declared synthetic binary hierarchy. Neither the interval utility nor Experiment 5 implies external empirical coverage has been established.

## B. Manuscript listings / algorithms

| Listing | Construct | Artifact | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Structured Interview DNA | `schemas/interview_dna.schema.json`, `examples/paper/interview_dna.example.json` | Complete public schema/example |
| 2 | EvidencePacket | `research_core/evidence.py::EvidencePacket`, `schemas/evidence_packet.schema.json` | Complete reference structure |
| 3 | Lens routing | `research_core/routing.py::select_highest_specificity`, `BACKOFF_SEQUENCE`, `architecture/lens-router.md` | Complete public decision rules |

| 5 | Candidate-state adaptation | `research_core/candidate_state.py::CandidateStateModel` | Complete reference separation/consent logic |
| 6 | Transcript de-identification | `research_core/privacy.py::deidentify_transcript` | Partial by design | Contact/date handling is executable; person/company/location NER is a pluggable reviewed dependency. The repository does **not** claim production-grade de-identification accuracy. |
| 7 | Minimized Context Package | `research_core/privacy.py::MinimizedContextPackage`, `schemas/minimized_context.schema.json` | Complete |
| 8 | Plain-language explanation | `research_core/explanation.py::generate_explanation` | Complete reference logic |

| 10 | Lens load/validation | `research_core/lens.py::load_lens`, `validate_interview_dna` | Complete lightweight validator | JSON Schema files remain the normative contract. |
| 11 | Hierarchical inference | `research_core/inference.py` | Complete reference logic |

| 13 | Routing class / backoff | `research_core/routing.py` | Complete |
| 14 | Candidate follow-up prioritization runtime | `research_core/service.py` | Integrated reference subset; see `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INTEGRATION_COVERAGE_MATRIX.md` |

## C. Thresholds and initialization parameters

All initial values are centralized in `config/paper_defaults.json` so a reviewer can distinguish declared initial settings from learned parameters.

| Manuscript item | Repo representation | Status / caution |
|---|---|---|
| prior strength `lambda_0 = 10` | `prior_strength_lambda0` | Documented; relationship to manuscript `alpha_0` should be clarified in v1.3 before treating it as an executable prior vector. |
| `kappa = 20` “half-life in observations” | `half_life_observations_kappa` | **Manuscript ambiguity.** `kappa` is also used for hierarchical concentration parameters. No hidden implementation is invented. Rename/define in v1.3. |
| backoff `gamma = 0.7` | `backoff_discount_gamma`; `route_mixture` | Executable |
| temporal `delta = 0.02/month` | `temporal_decay_delta_per_month`; `exponential_recency_weight` | Executable when evidence age is supplied in months; demo uses the mathematically equivalent half-life-to-rate conversion in days. |
| KL review threshold `0.3` | `kl_drift_review_threshold`; `kl_divergence` | Metric executable; threshold not claimed validated |
| ECE secondary target `0.10` | `ece_secondary_target`; `top_label_ece` | Metric executable; target remains secondary/empirical and is not treated as proof of calibration. `vector_ece` is supplementary only. |
| support ceiling example `0.85` | `support_ceiling_example`; `research_core/policy.py::apply_support_ceiling` | Executable policy cap; not probability |
| abstention threshold example `0.3` | `abstention_threshold_example`; `should_abstain` | Executable configurable policy |
| minimum sample size `30` | `minimum_sample_size_example` | Documented only; v1.3 should clarify what operation is gated because hierarchical shrinkage is already continuous below and above 30. |
| maximum parents `6` | `maximum_declared_parents`; `PARENT_CARDINALITY_CAPS` | Executable; test verifies 22,050 configurations |

## D. Manuscript issues exposed by the audit

These should be corrected in manuscript v1.3 rather than hidden in code:

1. **`primary_probability` in Listing 4** should be renamed `primary_priority_weight` (or similar) unless the Lens is Evaluation-Ready and held-out calibration has been established.
2. **`confidence` in Listing 9 AuditRecord** should become `diagnostic_weight`, `support`, or a typed field that distinguishes support from calibrated probability.
3. **Symbol collision for `kappa`.** Section 5 uses `kappa_c`, `kappa_i`, `kappa_a` as Dirichlet concentration parameters, while Appendix B/Table 19 uses `kappa` for a “half-life.” Rename the latter (for example `h_n`) or define a separate prior-decay quantity.
4. **`lambda_0` versus `alpha_0`.** The appendix says prior strength `lambda_0 = 10`, while the hierarchy writes `pi_u ~ Dirichlet(alpha_0)`. v1.3 should explicitly define whether `alpha_0 = lambda_0 * pi_base` or use one notation consistently.
5. **Minimum sample size = 30.** The manuscript should say exactly which release/fitting operation this gates. The Bayesian hierarchy itself does not suddenly switch methods at 30 observations.
6. **“Prediction” wording in limitations.** Candidate-side ordered practice priorities should not be casually called employer predictions.
7. **De-identification claim boundary.** Listing 6 is a procedure/interface, not evidence that PII removal has been empirically validated. The text should state that production de-identification requires validated entity detection and review.

## E. Current completeness assessment

- Core Section 5 equations with an executable public counterpart: **15/15**. This is an executable-counterpart count, **not** a claim that all fifteen equations are integrated into one runtime.
- Candidate follow-up runtime: Eq. **3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11** are reached directly or indirectly from `prioritize_followups`; Eq. **4 is partial** because the runtime uses company-level shrinkage against a supplied parent distribution rather than invoking the complete four-level hierarchy.
- Standalone / offline mathematical utilities: Eq. **1, 2, and 12–15** are not part of the candidate prioritization call graph. Eq. 12–14 are evaluation / monitoring metrics; Eq. 15 is an acquisition-scoring utility.
- Public decision algorithms/listings with counterpart: **14/14**, with Listing 6 intentionally partial at the NER layer and explicitly disclosed. Listing 14 is now described as the candidate follow-up prioritization runtime rather than shorthand for every mathematical utility.
- Declared thresholds centralized: **10/10**, but three (`lambda_0`, observation half-life `kappa`, min sample 30) require manuscript clarification before stronger executable semantics are justified.
- Controlled verification claims: artifact-backed for Experiments 1A, 1B, 2, and 3; Experiment 4 provides adversarial verification of corrective findings F1–F4; Experiment 5 provides the corrective synthetic hierarchy-approximation benchmark for F5. External participant, named-employer, calibration, fairness, current-production-LLM, and employment-outcome validation remain future empirical work.

See `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INTEGRATION_COVERAGE_MATRIX.md` for the reviewer-facing equation-by-equation separation of executable counterpart, runtime integration, evaluation use, controlled experimental coverage, and external empirical validation.

The target is conceptual reproducibility and reference-algorithm reproducibility, not disclosure of tenant configuration, reference client production policy, user data, proprietary operational thresholds, or complete production code.

## F. Manuscript v1.3 controlled-verification alignment

The v1.3 manuscript adds controlled results without changing the Section 5 mathematical definitions:

- **Experiment 1A:** seven candidate-side end-to-end invariant cases, including authorization hard-gating, aging, masking, routing eligibility, support, and fail-closed abstention.
- **Experiment 1B:** eleven controlled Lens/role-prior fixtures with positive and company-name negative controls.
- **Experiment 2:** one-factor sensitivity for `gamma`, `delta`, and `lambda_0`, plus controlled A2/A3/A4/A6 synthetic ablations.
- **Experiment 3:** six public-safe candidate-answer semantic regression fixtures; the current production language model is explicitly **not** rerun.

These experiments verify internal mechanism behavior, contract preservation, and reproducibility under controlled inputs. They do not establish the external empirical claims reserved by manuscript Sections 7.1–7.6.

## G. v1.4 corrective verification alignment

The corrective branch adds two experiments without rewriting the immutable v1.3 artifact:

- **Experiment 4 — Adversarial Mathematical Alignment:** four deterministic cases reproduce the frozen v1.3 counterexamples and verify the v1.4 corrections for Eq. 15 parameter information gain, top-label calibration diagnostics, permitted-category support, and zero-permitted-mass routing.
- **Experiment 5 — Hierarchy Approximation Benchmark:** a pre-specified synthetic binary hierarchy compares recursive plug-in shrinkage with a deterministic uncertainty-propagating numerical reference across sparse, intermediate, and dense regimes.

Experiment 4 is evidence of internal mathematical–implementation correction, not external calibration or real-world efficacy. Experiment 5 is evidence about approximation behavior under the declared synthetic hierarchy, not proof that either estimator is externally valid for employer behavior or employment outcomes.

The v1.4 integration gate therefore consists of the paper artifact validator, documentation-alignment validator, unit tests, deterministic demo, Experiments 1A/1B/2/3/4/5, committed-output zero diff, and `git diff --check`.
